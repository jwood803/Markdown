Just over 6 months ago, I honestly didn't even know what Xamarin was or what they did. I've heard of the Mono project, of course, but that's only with the very brief "It can run on Mac and Linux" thing.

In around July or so of 2014 I somehow found that Xamarin was having their Evolve conference in Atlanta that coming October. I then thought, *Just a three hour drive for my first conference? Sure, I'll go to this!* I was also very pleased by how awesome the Xamarin team was in helping me sign up for this conference. I'm already starting to get pumped for it at this point.

It's now October and a Tuesday, the day before the official conference kicks off. I arrive at the hotel after three ours of driving and not wanting to drive again until I head back home on Friday. With this being my first conference I'm not sure what to expect. I decide to go ahead and register after checking into the hotel. There's a welcome party and I roam around to get a feel of the area. Then I see a table that sells beer so I figured why not get one. I try to pay the guy for the beer and he says "No charge". Wait...this conference has an open bar. This was definitely a good idea to come here.
