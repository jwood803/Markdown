With the latest news of the release of [Visual Studio 2015]() some folks may not have realized but included in it is the newest release of F# 4.0. The .NET Blog has also [officially announced the RTM](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/20/announcing-the-rtm-of-visual-f-4-0.aspx). The most exciting thing about this release of F# is that, since F# has been open source for quite some time now, most of the fixes and updates were made by the F# community.

What exactly is different in the new version of F# is very nicely highlighted in the below video by [Lincoln Atkinson](http://latkin.org/blog/).
