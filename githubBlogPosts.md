[Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com), a former GitHubber, made a very interesting post about how [GitHub writes blog posts](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-writes-blog-posts/). One of the things that seemed to strike me the most interesting was that they use continuous integration on their posts. *Whoa*, I thought to myself, *That's pretty cool to have your blog posts run through a build to test for certain things.* Then I had the crazy idea....why not do the same for my posts?

#### F# Blog Post Tests
Zach uses Ruby to write his tests for his posts, however I'm going to use F# (big surprise there, right?).
